# Password Generator

## Description

The challenge was to make a Password Generator web application functional with JavaScript. The application creates randomized passwords between 8 and 128 characters long. The user can customize the passwords by choosing different specs when prompted, such as lowercase characters, uppercase characters, numbers, and special characters. My strategy for this challenge was to create arrays of the different character types, then use conditional statements to determine which specs to include in the final password. I used a shuffle function to randomize the results. A challenge for me as a developer, moving forward, would be to try to shorten my code and make it more succinct.
